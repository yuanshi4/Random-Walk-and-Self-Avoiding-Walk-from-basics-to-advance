# Random-Walk-and-Self-Avoiding-Walk-from-basics-to-advance

### In this project, I implemented five algorithms, from the most fundamental one like a simple random walk to more advanced ones like the pivot algorithm.

### The five algorithms include a simple random walk and 4 self-avoiding random walks. Eventually, I also evaluated a random walk in 3D space as additional exploration.

### In each section, I will begin by introducing the basics of each algorithm, showing their pseudocode, then moving on to implementation and testing. Finally I hope to observe and compare the advantages and disadvantages in terms of performances in different scenarios.
